## ThorStarter Contracts

This repository contains the ThorStarter Token, Faucet and Staking contracts
used for the TGE & sale.

We're working on building out our IDO platform & governance, those contracts will
come later closer to the first project IDO. (Wouldn't wan't people to asume too
many things from reading them while they are still changing and evolving a lot)

### Building

This repository uses the `hardhat` library to test & deploy it's Solidity contracts.

`hardhat test` runs the test suite

And `hardhat run scripts/deploy.js` deploys all the scripts for the sale.
